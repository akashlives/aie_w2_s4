Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big \\nmistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And \\nsome said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that  no \\none should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one \\nman had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to \\nbe nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a \\nsmall cafe in Rickmansw orth suddenly realized what it was that \\nhad been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the \\nworld could be made a good and happy place.
